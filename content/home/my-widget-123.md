I am a development economist with broad research interests in the context of India. My research can be categorized into three parallel agendas:  (a) functioning of front-line judicial institutions and their downstream effects; (b) local collective action and coordination in the context of agricultural production; and (c) structural transformation and rural landholding inequality.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar (Program on Indian Economy) at the Department of Economics, University of California at San Diego. I received my PhD from the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California at Berkeley. I will be on the economics job market 2022-23.
